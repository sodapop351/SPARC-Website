%% The basic blocks world consists of a robotic arm that can manipulate
%% configurations of same-sized cubic blocks on a table. There are
%% limitations to what the robotic arm can do. It can move
%% unoccupied blocks, one at a time, onto other unoccupied blocks or
%% onto the table. (An unoccupied block is one that does not have another
%% block stacked on it.) At any given step, a block can be in at most
%% one location; in other words, a block can be directly on top of one
%% other block, or on the table. We do not impose a limit on how tall
%% our towers can be. Our table is big enough to hold all the blocks,
%% even if they are not stacked. We do not take into account spatial
%% relationships of towers, just which blocks are on top
%% of each other and which blocks are on the table.
